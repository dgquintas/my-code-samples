<H1>Akismet API Documentation Version 1.1 </H1>
<H2>About the Akismet Service</H2>
<P>Akismet is basically a big machine that sucks up all the data it possibly 
can, looks for patterns, and learns from its mistakes. Thus far it has been 
highly effective at stopping spam and adapting to new techniques and attempts to 
evade it, and time will tell how it stands up. I've tried to keep the API 
interaction as simple as possible.</P>
<H3>A Good Consumer</H3>
<P>To interact fully with the Akismet API your program really should be putting 
data back into the system as well as just taking it out. If it is at all 
possible within the framework of your application you should have a way for your 
users to submit missed spam and false positives, otherwise Akismet will never 
learn from its mistakes.</P>
<H2>User Agent</H2>
<P>If it is at all possible, please modify the user agent string you request 
with to be of the following format:</P><PRE>Application Name/Version | Plugin Name/Version</PRE>
<P>So in the WordPress plugin this looks like:</P><PRE>$ksd_user_agent = "WordPress/$wp_version | Akismet/1.11";
</PRE>
<H2>Call Structure</H2>
<P>All calls to Akismet are POST requests much like a web form would send. The 
request variables should be constructed like a query string, 
<CODE>key=value</CODE> and multiple variables separated by ampersands. Don't 
forget to URL escape the values. </P>
<P>In the WordPress plugin the POST part of things is abstracted out in this 
function:</P><PRE>function ksd_http_post($request, $host, $path, $port = 80) {
	global $ksd_user_agent;

	$http_request  = "POST $path HTTP/1.0\r\n";
	$http_request .= "Host: $host\r\n";
	$http_request .= "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=" . get_settings('blog_charset') . "\r\n";
	$http_request .= "Content-Length: " . strlen($request) . "\r\n";
	$http_request .= "User-Agent: $ksd_user_agent\r\n";
	$http_request .= "\r\n";
	$http_request .= $request;

	$response = '';
	if( false !== ( $fs = @fsockopen($host, $port, $errno, $errstr, 3) ) ) {
		fwrite($fs, $http_request);
		while ( !feof($fs) )
			$response .= fgets($fs, 1160); // One TCP-IP packet
		fclose($fs);
		$response = explode("\r\n\r\n", $response, 2);
	}
	return $response;
}  </PRE>
<P>This sends a POST request to the specified host and port with a timeout of 3 
seconds. The HTTP request is constructed with full headers. The response headers 
are discarded and the function returns the body of the response. </P>
<H2>API Key</H2>
<P>Use of the Akismet API requires an API key, which are currently only being 
provided along with accounts to <A 
href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</A>. The API key is used as a 
subdomain in the call, for example if you had the API key <CODE>aoeu1aoue</CODE> 
you would make all API calls to <CODE>aoeu1aoue.rest.akismet.com</CODE>. The 
only exception to this is the <A 
href="http://akismet.com/development/api/#verify-key">verify-key</A> call, which 
may be made to <CODE>rest.akismet.com</CODE> without an API key subdomain. </P>
<H2 id=verify-key>Key Verification — <CODE>rest.akismet.com/1.1/verify 
key</CODE> </H2>
<P>The key verification call should be made before beginning to use the service. 
It requires two variables, key and blog.</P>
<DL>
  <DT><CODE>key</CODE> (required) 
  <DD>The API key being verified for use with the API 
  <DT><CODE>blog</CODE> (required) 
  <DD>The front page or home URL of the instance making the request. For a blog 
  or wiki this would be the front page. </DD></DL>
<P>The call returns "<CODE>valid</CODE>" if the key is valid. This is the one 
call that can be made without the API key subdomain. Using our example function 
from above, this is how the API key is verified in the WP plugin: <PRE>function akismet_verify_key( $key ) {
	global $ksd_api_host, $ksd_api_port;
	$blog = urlencode( get_option('home') );
	$response = ksd_http_post("key=$key&amp;blog=$blog", 'rest.akismet.com', '/1.1/verify-key', $ksd_api_port);
	if ( 'valid' == $response[1] )
		return true;
	else
		return false;
}</PRE>
<H2 id=comment-check>Comment Check — 
<CODE>api-key.rest.akismet.com/1.1/comment-check</CODE></H2>
<P>This is basically the core of everything. This call takes a number of 
arguments and characteristics about the submitted content and then returns a 
thumbs up or thumbs down. Almost everything is optional, but performance can 
drop dramatically if you exclude certain elements. I would recommend erring on 
the side of too much data, as everything is used as part of the Akismet 
signature.</P>
<DL>
  <DT><CODE>blog </CODE>(required) 
  <DD>The front page or home URL of the instance making the request. For a blog 
  or wiki this would be the front page. 
  <DT><CODE>user_ip</CODE> (required) 
  <DD>IP address of the comment submitter. 
  <DT><CODE>user_agent</CODE> (required) 
  <DD>User agent information. 
  <DT><CODE>referrer</CODE> (note spelling) 
  <DD>The content of the HTTP_REFERER header should be sent here. 
  <DT><CODE>permalink</CODE> 
  <DD>The permanent location of the entry the comment was submitted to. 
  <DT><CODE>comment_type</CODE> 
  <DD>May be blank, comment, trackback, pingback, or a made up value like 
  "registration". 
  <DT><CODE>comment_author</CODE> 
  <DD>Submitted name with the comment 
  <DT><CODE>comment_author_email</CODE> 
  <DD>Submitted email address 
  <DT><CODE>comment_author_url</CODE> 
  <DD>Commenter URL. 
  <DT><CODE>comment_content</CODE> 
  <DD>The content that was submitted. 
  <DT>Other server enviroment variables 
  <DD>In PHP there is an array of enviroment variables called 
  <CODE>$_SERVER</CODE> which contains information about the web server itself 
  as well as a key/value for every HTTP header sent with the request. This data 
  is highly useful to Akismet as how the submited content interacts with the 
  server can be very telling, so please include as much information as possible. 
  </DD></DL>
<P>This call returns either "true" or "false" as the body content. True means 
that the comment is spam and false means that it isn't spam. If you are having 
trouble triggering you can send "viagra-test-123" as the author and it will 
trigger a true response, always. </P>
<H2 id=submit-spam>Submit Spam — 
<CODE>api-key.rest.akismet.com/1.1/submit-spam</CODE></H2>
<P>This call is for submitting comments that weren't marked as spam but should 
have been. It takes identical arguments as comment check.</P>
<H2 id=submit-ham>Submit Ham — 
<CODE>api-key.rest.akismet.com/1.1/submit-ham</CODE></H2>
<P>This call is intended for the marking of false positives, things that were 
incorrectly marked as spam. It takes identical arguments as <A 
href="http://akismet.com/development/api/#comment-check">comment check</A> and 
submit spam.</P>
