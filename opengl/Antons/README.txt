= Info =

See "LICENCE.txt" for licence information.

For updated information about this demonstration code, see:
http://antongerdelan.net/opengl/book_info.html

Original 3d mesh .blend files are in a separate download to keep main file
smaller:
http://antongerdelan.net/opengl/book_code/book_code_blender.zip

There is also an example of code for "Hello Triangle" for OpenGL 2.1 for
reference

All of these examples were built with a 64-bit Xubuntu Linux machine, so there
are Makefiles for 64-bit linux. I'm also adding project files for 32-bit linux,
32-bit windows (GCC and Visual Studio), and 64-bit Apple OS X but this will take
a few days and I might introduce some bugs. Send me an e-mail for any queries or
requests here.

= Compiling =
The libraries reside in the common/ folder

common/include - header files
common/linux_i386 - 32-bit linux libraries
common/linux_x86_64 - 64-bit linux libraries
common/msvc110 - 32-bit Windows visual studio libraries
common/osx_64 - 64-bit apple OS X libraries
common/win32 - 32-bit Windows GCC (mingw) libraries

== Linux ==

* install the GNU Compiler Collection - usually by installing a
"build-essentials" package via the package manager on your distribution.
* open a terminal and cd to the demo of choice

64-bit systems:
make -f Makefile.linux64

32-bit systems:
make -f Makefile.linux32

== 64-bit Apple OS X ==

I don't have an Apple machine so these may not all have a Makefile available
right away. I'll do my best to update this and test all the projects - check
back for updates. The Apple drivers are not great - expect bugs in some demos.

* install the GNU Compiler Collection - usually by installing XCode
* open a terminal and cd to the demo of choice

make -f Makefile.osx

== Windows with GCC ==

I only provided 32-bit versions of the Makefile and libraries here. If you want
to add a 64-bit build it's pretty easy to copy the 32-bit Makefile and change
the folder. You will need to recompile GLFW, GLEW, AssImp, and Freetype though.
The 32-bit builds will run on all Windows machines - I use 32-bit builds on my
64-bit Windows.

* install the GNU Compiler Collection - usually by installing the MinGW toolkit.
http://www.mingw.org/
* open a console and cd to the demo of choice

make -f Makefile.win32

* copy the .dll files from the main folder to the demo folder

== Windows with Visual Studio ==

I provided some Visual Studio 2012 project files.
These are in a separate download because I was getting time-out problems with my
web hosting provider with larger files:

http://antongerdelan.net/opengl/book_code/book_code_vs.zip

Extract this file and copy the visual_studio folder into the main tutorials
folder. It should look like this:

book_code\  tutorials folder from main download
book_code\00_hello_triangle\  first demo
book_code\visual_studio  extracted folder
book_code\visual_studio\tutorials.sln  visual studio 2012 main solution file

You can find an overarching solution file in the main folder. This should
convert well to most versions of visual studio. I used 32-bit versions of the
libraries, but there's no reason that you can't add 64-bit versions if you
prefer.
