* removed binding keyword from sampler declarations in shaders that I changed
from #version 420 #version 400. left a couple in #version 420 with the keyword
updated book_code_vs.zip to suit also
for comparison - note in top of shaders affected
* reworked "HACK" comment in normal mapping shader to something more informative

* added Apple OS X Makefiles for most demos. still to do (when I can borrow a Mac):
- demos using assimp library
- demos using freetype library
* changed all shaders with #version 420 to #version 400 so that it will run on
Apple and other machines with 4.0 or 4.1 support without needing to modify it
* fixed a segfault bug in demo 02_shaders/ (thanks for spotting Andrea!)
* got assimp library working for OS X, added Mac makefiles for mesh demos
