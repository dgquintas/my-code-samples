The easiest is to "su" as user postgres whilst the pg_hba.conf file 
contains 

# TYPE  DATABASE    USER        CIDR-ADDRESS          METHOD
local   all         all                               ident

in order to allow connections from a unix socket. Note that the user 
must exist in the system (as postgres does, having been created during
the PG installation). 

Once we are postgres:

createuser -e -D -E -P -R -S newuser

the -e echoes the SQL commands being run
-D: disable database creation privileges
-E: encrypts user's pw
-P: prompt for newuser's password
-R: can't create roles (users)
-S: isn't superuser

and possibly the following as well:

createdb -O newuser -e newdb

-e: echo commands
-O user: sets user as the owner of the newly created database
